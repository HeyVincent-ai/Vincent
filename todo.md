* it does seem like it forgets the API key in a new session.  i think we need to tell the skill where to store it and retrieve it from?
* homepage fixes for install instructions?  like clawdbot / openclaw specific things?  npx clawhub install etc...  maybe "openclaw" tab with icon, and "other agents" with openskill instructions
* move to heyvincent.ai domain
